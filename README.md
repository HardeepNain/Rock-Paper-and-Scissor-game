# Rock-Paper-and-Scissor-game
A minimalist, arcade-style implementation of the classic game. The interface uses large, tappable icons with subtle hover/tap effects. On each round, the computer selects a move at random; results are shown instantly with animated highlights and sound cues. Players can reset the match, and view a running scoreboard.
